### Added
- Created the initial C++20 / Qt 6 / libmpv Windows player application and CMake build configuration.

- Added the `Build Windows Portable` GitHub Actions workflow for Windows 2022 / MSVC 2022 x64.
- Added automatic libmpv development-package download and `.github/scripts/make-mpv-lib.ps1` to generate the MSVC import library from the libmpv DLL exports.
- Added audio-track and subtitle-track selectors populated from mpv's track list.
- Added external subtitle loading for common subtitle formats.

### Changed
- Reworked fullscreen controls so they overlay the video rather than reducing the video area's size.
- Added animated fullscreen control slide-in/slide-out, automatic hiding, and cursor hiding.

### Fixed
- Corrected Qt MOC/AUTOMOC configuration and source formatting so `MainWindow` meta-object code is generated and linked correctly on Windows.

### Verification
